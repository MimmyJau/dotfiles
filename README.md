Mimmy's Dotfiles
================

Setup
-----

Method taken from this [post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11071754). Additional info provided in this [blog](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles).

When migrating to a new computer, see section titled "Install your dotfiles onto a new system (or migrate to this setup)". Note that instead of `.cfg`, you should use `.dotfiles` in all the commands. You may also need to rename path in `.zshrc` if account name is different.

Notes
-----

Use `config add -u` instead of `config add -A` since the latter will add untracked files.
